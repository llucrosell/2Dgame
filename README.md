2D Game by RyiSnow

Hello everyone, in this project I'm recreating the game developed in YouTube's tutorial provided by RyiSnow. 
You can watch his videos here: https://youtu.be/om59cwR7psI

I'm a university student, and I'm doing this project to deepen my programming knowledge. The last course i learned Java, and I've been playing Minecraft for a long time.
When I started playing the game, I discovered that a lot of people were making mods for the game (written in Java). And I asked myself "How they do it?" (yes, like the TV program in Discovery, I love it btw).
And then, i started thinking how the game works, like how you render the world, how you load textures, how you describe an entire entity, etc.

Finally, someday appeared in my recommended videos on YouTube a guy (RyiSnow) telling how to develop a simple 2D Game written in Java. 
So yes, now I'm here developing a simple 2D game, learning english (my native language is Spanish and Catalan) and implementing a bunch of functions and a lot of cool stuff that I'm finding over the Internet.
